# ConfidentAI

This is our backend infrastructure for a Mock Interviewer with Feedback. We measure 4 behaviors: 
1. Facial Gestures
2. Vocal Tone
3. Eye Contact
4. Gestures

We train Facial Gestures and Vocal Tone using datasets while using open-source projects Posture and Eye Contact.

At the end, we give the user personalized feedback based on these 4 metrics
